          <h3 class="lead mb-5">AI used to fight cancer by predicting behaviour of mutations</h3>
          <p class="paratext lead mb-5">Cutting edge AI has been used to predict how tumours will grow in a patient exhibiting early symptoms of cancer. This is achieved by using Machine learning systems based on collosal training data sets on historical mutations of the DNA which has caused cancerous cells and tumours. <br><br>This reasearch, pioneered as a joint project between the Institute of Cancer Research London (ICR) and the University of Edinburgh has the potential to yield huge benefits. By being able to predict where a cancerous mutation will grow next, that area can be pre-emptively treated so that the tumour is erradicated before it can develop any sort of resistance to the drugs. Although this might not remove the disease entirely, it has already been shown to be excellent at containing it and stopping from spreading to other regions of the body. Particular prowess has already been seen in lung, breast, kidney and bowel cancers with doctors hopeful it will be able to be used even more widespread than this.<br><img align='center' src="img/cancer.jpg" alt="A cancerous tumour"><br>Dr Andrea Sottoriva, who led the team said: "We've developed a powerful artificial intelligence tool which can make predictions about the future steps in the evolution of tumours based on certain patterns of mutation that have so far remained hidden within complex data sets.
"With this tool we hope to remove one of cancer's trump cards - the fact that it evolves unpredictably, without us knowing what is going to happen next. By giving us a peek into the future, we could potentially use this AI tool to intervene at an earlier stage, predicting cancer's next move."<br><br>While the fight against cancer may still not be over, this is still a historic development that will pave the way for many more future developments.</p>
